# Setting up Github with Google Apps Script
Since Google Apps script doesn't have a nice version control system (or any for that matter), we use an extension to push/pull our code.

First, install (Google Apps Script GitHub Assistant)[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-apps-script-github/lfjcgcmkmjjlieihflfhjopckgpelofo/] as an extension

Second, generate a personal access token via (GitHub)[https://github.com/settings/tokens] with repo and gist permissions.


Finally, go into a Google Apps script and click on the extension options found next to the function pull down. It should ask for a username & password/token. Enter your username and generated token.
